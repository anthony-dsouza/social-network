This project uses Caddy.
To use it you have to install it first:


https://caddyserver.com/docs/install#debian-ubuntu-raspbian


After installing, run `caddy start` while you are running the backend server, and run `caddy stop` after you have finished.


You can still use localhost:8080 for HTTP connection.
